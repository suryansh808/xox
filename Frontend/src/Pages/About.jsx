        <h2>Built to Solve Real Hiring Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Born out of frustration with traditional hiring processes, Doltec was

          single, intelligent recruitment platform. From day one, we‚Äôve focused
          on removing friction and maximizing visibility for every stakeholder
          in the hiring chain.
